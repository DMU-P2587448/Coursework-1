<p class="synopsis2"> After accepting responsibility for Harvie Dent's death, Batman (Christian Bale) disappeared into the darkness for eight years.
  He and Commissioner Gordon (Gary Oldman) had to go to dubious things and sacrifice everything they valued in the name of greater good.

  have appeared. Batman can no longer hide in the shadows and must face new threats, to save Gotham once more. </p>
